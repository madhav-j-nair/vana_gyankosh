## HOW TO USE IT

If you are not blind or stupid you will find a space where you can type the plant name, a dropdown cox with options which you need and finally a button to get details. I know that most of you who are reading this readme have lesser iq than an average autistic child but yet I think that you understand that the results in the box are to be read and also that they only appear if you click the button.

### WHO SHOULD USE IT

people who want to know more about plants, rookie farmers, and people who have short temper and a boss who can get on their nerves should definitely give it a try

### REFERENCE
